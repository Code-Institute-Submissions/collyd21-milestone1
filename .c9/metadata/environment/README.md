Information as regards to the projects I was been involved in has been taken from my current employers website www.stsgroup.ie and also some additional information added to these by me.\n### Media\nThe profile photo is a photo I took myself and used some editing software to turn it into a usuable background image.\n### Acknowledgements\nThe titles for this Readme file itself were used from the Code Institute, Grade 5 sample projects section. As this was my first Readme, I wasn't sure what was expected in the file. This has given me an excellent basis and layout to use going forward.\n\n","undoManager":{"mark":-2,"position":0,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":14,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["         ___        ______     ____ _                 _  ___  ","        / \\ \\      / / ___|   / ___| | ___  _   _  __| |/ _ \\ ","       / _ \\ \\ /\\ / /\\___ \\  | |   | |/ _ \\| | | |/ _` | (_) |","      / ___ \\ V  V /  ___) | | |___| | (_) | |_| | (_| |\\__, |","     /_/   \\_\\_/\\_/  |____/   \\____|_|\\___/ \\__,_|\\__,_|  /_/ "," ----------------------------------------------------------------- ","","","Hi there!
