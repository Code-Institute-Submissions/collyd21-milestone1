# Colm Doyle Personal Profile
User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

This website was design to showcase myself. It includes four pages, an About section, a Resume section, a Projects section and lastly a Contact form. I wanted it to be in a format that was easy to understand and extract the relevant information the user may be looking for, with ease.
### User Stories
Employers will want to see a collection of Colm's work and portfolio.

Recruiters will want to see my resume and previous relevant experience.
### Strategy
I wanted this site to be very easy to use and navigate. Also that the user can easily access the information about myself they are looking for.
### Scope
The whole idea behind this project is to show my experience in my current position. While also bring into to account that the site was build from scratch by myself, which highlights my skills as a developer.

### Surface
I went for a greyscale because it looks minialist and clean. I've added a hint of the blue just to make certain features of the pages standout. All page layouts are produced the same so that user is comfortable navigating from page to page and each new section is something they are familiar with.
## Technologies
For this project I used Bootstrap and also Fontawesome. I also implemented the "Roboto" font from Google Fonts.
## Features
The icons used in the "About" and "Footer" sections use the Font Awesome icon feature. I think it adds more substance than just text.

I also use the components, Buttons, Forms, Jumbotron and Nav in Bootsrap.

I used the bootstrap hidden feature to hide my image when the website is viewed on mobile. It makes it look more compact and flows better.

I made an icon with my initals to be added to the browser tab using Favicon. Its a small touch but only adds to the look of the site.

After alot of searching online and trial/error, I finally figured out how to change the standard bootstrap toggler icon to a custom colour. It turns out the border is set with custom color by border-color property in CSS and for the lines inside the border, you need the alter the attributes in RGB for the SVG image file used by bootstrap for this icon.
## Testing
I have tested the links for my CV download, LinkedIn and Github and used the (target="_blank") to make sure it opens to a new tab so that the user is still connected to the original page.
I have also used the W3 HTML Validator to assess my code is valid and conforms to best practices and standards.
I had issues with getting the Favicon to show up on the tab. I had to rectify this by adding it to the root directory of the project.

## Credits
### Content
All personal information was written by myself. Information as regards to the projects I was been involved in has been taken from my current employers website stsgroup.ie and also some additional information added to these by me.
### Media
The profile photo is a photo I took myself and used some editing software to turn it into a useable background image.

The below images in the project section were sourced online.

Data Centre section - IM Cleaning Solutions website. This image was a perfect example of a finished data hall and also the greyscal already fitted to my website theme.

Bio-pharma Section - Unique Control Systems website. I found this image on a website that sells pharma instruments.

Commercial Fit-out Section - Wework website. This is an image of the finished building I had worked on.
### Acknowledgements
The titles for this Readme file itself were used from the Code Institute, Grade 5 sample projects section. As this was my first Readme, I wasn't sure what was expected in the file. This has given me an excellent basis and layout to use going forward.

I also like the clean, minialist look of this project example and it inspired me to do the same.

The navbar layout on top and then switching to a dropdown toggle button was inspired by influenced by Devonstank.com and also from my previous Code Institute lesson involving the Whiskey Drop website.
