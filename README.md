# Colm Doyle Personal Profile
User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

This website was design to showcase myself. It includes four pages, an About section, a Resume section, a Projects section and lastly a Contact form.
## Demo
A live demo can be found here [Colm Doyle Personal Profile](https://collyd21/github.com/io/milestone1/)
### User Stories
As an employer I want to see a collection of Colm's work.

As a recruiter I want to see Colm's resume and previous relevant experience.
### Strategy
I wanted this site to be very easy to use and navigate. Also that the user can easily access the information about myself they are looking for.
### Scope
The whole idea behind this project is to show my experience in my current position. While also bring into to account that the site was build from scratch by myself, which highlights my skills as a developer.

### Surface
I went for a greyscale because it looks minialist and clean. I've added a hint of the blue just to make certain features of the pages standout. All page layouts are produced the same so that user is comfortable navigating from page to page and each new section is something they are familiar with.
## Technologies
## Features
The icons used in the "About" and "Footer" sections use the Font Awesome icon feature. I think it adds more substance than just text.

I also use the components, Buttons, Forms, Jumbotron and Nav in Bootsrap.

## Credits
### Content
All personal information was written by myself. Information as regards to the projects I was been involved in has been taken from my current employers website www.stsgroup.ie and also some additional information added to these by me.
### Media
The profile photo is a photo I took myself and used some editing software to turn it into a usuable background image.
### Acknowledgements
The titles for this Readme file itself were used from the Code Institute, Grade 5 sample projects section. As this was my first Readme, I wasn't sure what was expected in the file. This has given me an excellent basis and layout to use going forward.
